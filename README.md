# Calculator - Python

It is my Second little program using Python - OOP

In Terminal, you will be able to make simple calculations

## Usage

in a terminal, run a python REPL with

``` bash
    python3
```

then type

```python 
    import main
```


Or got to : [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/) and Copy/Paste code from "main.py" to Programiz


## Notes :

the run method consist only of high level instruction, easily readable for a human to understand
what happen.

smaller functions means easier maintenance and modification.

If you want to modify the prompt from "--->" to "ssss{=======>"

it surely makes more sense to modify `_display_prompt` than `_calculate`
